	<h1>Test Bot</h1>
	<h2>General Information about the Bot</h2>
	<p>This is a test bot that I am writing in order to perfect my python knowledge. This is not in anyway motivated by 
		commercial purposes. I am even going to host the code in Github once I am done.</p>
	<p>My crawler respects the <b><a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt standard</a></b></p>
	<h2>IP Address</h2>
	<p>I will be testing this bot mainly from my home. My IP address is <em>117.194.34.138</em></p>
	<p>You can mail me in this mail address: <a href="mailto:neelpulse@gmail.com">neelpulse@gmail.com</a></p>
